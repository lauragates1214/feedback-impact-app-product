# Real-Time Feedback Platform

> A platform for capturing insights before they slip away.

Enables organisations to run structured feedback sessions in which Leads ask questions and Voices respond, all optimised for smartphones with no downloads or accounts required.

## The Problem

**Traditional feedback collection is broken:**

Published research shows completion rates of just 44% in educational settings, 10-20% for events and conferences, and 5-10% for community organisations. Real-world experience is often worse.

This means **organisations are making critical decisions based on feedback from just 5-20% of participants**, and even that feedback is diluted by time and distance from the actual experience.

**The stakes:**
- In organisations that rely on funding, feedback means the difference between securing grants and losing them
- In corporate settings, it shapes strategic decisions, measures employee engagement, and validates training investments
- In research, it determines which projects continue and demonstrates the impact needed for institutional funding
- For all sectors, it's the difference between understanding impact and guessing

**What's being lost:**
- Spontaneous insights and emotional responses experienced during the event
- In-the-moment reactions and creative ideas
- Transformative realisations that fade within hours
- The voices of 80-95% of participants

Research shows that **77% of users prefer organisations that ask for their feedback**, but traditional methods make it difficult to respond when insights are most valuable.

## The Solution

This platform transforms fleeting insights into structured data through:

- **Frictionless access**: QR code entry, no downloads or logins required
- **Real-time collection**: Capture insights while they're fresh
- **Mobile-first design**: Works on any smartphone
- **Research-backed approach**: Built from work with vulnerable populations including refugees and low-income communities

### Why It Works

**Research Foundation:**  
The platform emerged from the Objects Without Borders research project, which revealed a critical insight: despite various technological barriers, smartphones were consistently the most accessible technology across all demographics studied.

**Key Findings:**
- High smartphone ownership across all demographics
- Immediate willingness to scan QR codes vs. resistance to app downloads
- Higher quality responses when collected in real-time vs. retrospectively
- Strong preference for anonymous participation in sensitive contexts

**Pilot Results:**  
- 90-100% participation rates vs. 5-15% with traditional methods
- Increased feedback participation rates by 150%

## What Makes It Different

**Purpose-built for real-world environments**  
Designed for dynamic, messy settingsâ€”not controlled presentations. Mobile-first approach, not laptop/desktop assumptions.

**Research-backed inclusive design**  
Built from work with vulnerable populations. Anonymous participation options. Accessibility-first architecture, not retrofitted solutions.

**Export-ready data**  
Responses automatically formatted for analysis and reporting. No platform lock-in. Participant access to own responses for continued reflection.

**Lightweight and focused**  
Single focus on feedback collection vs. feature-bloated platforms. Fast deployment, built-in analytics.
